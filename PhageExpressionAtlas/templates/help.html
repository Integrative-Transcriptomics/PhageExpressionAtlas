            Welcome to the PhageExpressionAtlas, your platform to explore various phage infections on the transcriptional level based on dual RNA-seq data. Here, we provide some general guidelines to work with the atlas and additional info. <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>In the current implementation, the PhageExpressionAtlas provides uniformly processed dual RNA-seq data of diverse phage infections for exploration and visualization.</li>
                <li>To find out more about the datasets that are currently hosted on the PhageExpressionAtlas visit <a href="/data-overview">Data Overview</a>.</li>
                <li>In order to explore the datasets currently hosted in the PhageExpressionAtlas you may visit the <a href="/dataset-exploration">Dataset Exploration</a> page. There, select your dataset and/or phage and host of interest to investigate host and phage gene expression on the transcriptional level. For instance, phage gene classification (early, middle, late) can be obtained and visualized in the genome viewer at their respective genomic location.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Data Overview</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Take a look at how the data was processed, which phages and hosts are represented in the data and which datasets are available. <br><br>

            <strong>Dataset Exploration</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Explore a dataset of your interest. Inspect overall patterns of host and phage transcription during infection, phage gene classes or study the expression of particular host or phage genes of interest. <br><br>

            <strong>Genome Viewer</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Explore the genome of your phage of interest labelled with phage gene classes resulting from a selected dual RNA-seq dataset.

            Do you have dual RNA-seq data of a phage infection that is not yet included in the PhageExpressionAtlas?<br>
            You can <a href="">let us know</a> and we will process your data and include it in the atlas. Alternatively, you can process that data yourself via our <a href="">pipeline</a> and <a href="">send the counts table directly to us</a>.
